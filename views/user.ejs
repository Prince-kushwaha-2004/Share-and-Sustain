                Turning Surplus into Sustenance
                In a world where some feast in excess, others go to bed hungry every night. At SHARE AND SUSTAIN, we
                believe in a simple yet powerful mission: to bridge the gap between those who have excess and those who
                can't afford even a single meal.
